# CPSC 210: Fourier Series Project:

## *About the project:*
**The goal of this project is to create a program that can take in a set of functions the user inputs, perform basic
operations involving them (addition, subtraction, products, quotients, and to some extent composition), and then 
compute the Fourier Series (odd, even and full range) for these functions on an interval specified by the user.**

This project is of particular interest to individuals who either aspire to become, or are currently involved in
science, especially engineers, mathematicians, and physicists, who make use of Fourier series in a variety of methods 
(solutions to separable Partial Differential Equations is a key example). This project is also useful for teachers and 
professors to aid students with visualization, along with providing said students a user-friendly and interactive 
program to explore how functions are represented through their Fourier series, and save functions they have previously 
worked with for future use. This project may also be of interest to a curious music theorist who is wanting to explore
acoustics and modes of vibration, which are closely related to Partial Differential Equations, and hence the Fourier 
Series. 

Being in the Physics and Mathematics combined honours program, and having been exposed to and used Fourier Series in a 
variety of my courses (Electricity and Magnetism, Quantum Mechanics, Partial Differential Equations, and Mathematical 
Analysis), I wanted to use the CPSC 210 course project as an avenue to explore this passion project, that I might not 
have worked on otherwise. I have also always been amazed at how significant visual aids can be at conveying mathematical
intuition, especially being an avid fan of the popular YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown. I feel that having an easy to 
approach and user-friendly program to explore Fourier series is something I would have found quite useful, and I also 
hope it inspires aspiring Physicists and Mathematics undergraduates who, like me, may not have much coding/programming 
experience to nevertheless create their own programs and further inspire younger students. 

## *Stretch Goals:*
Part of designing a project for CPSC 210 is understanding the feasibility of implementing certain functionality, and to
not underestimate the implementation of certain functionality. The initial objective was to create a Fourier Transform
visualization tool, which I felt would have been rather difficult to implement at a level I deemed satisfactory. I
therefore would like to have this as a stretch goal, and to aim for visualizing the Fourier Transform of a small subset
of functions for my final submission in Phase 4.

## *User Stories:*
A requirement of the CPSC 210 Project is to consider user stories when designing our projects. Below is a list of user
stories that I feel may be relevant to my project, and what a user interacting with this program may think as they use
it:

- As a user, I want to be able to add a **function** (X) to my analysis **worklist** (Y).
- As a user, I want to be able to view and modify functions already in my worklist.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose a function in my worklist, and compute its Fourier Series on an interval,
ideally of my choosing.
- As a user, I want to compare the Fourier Series of a function to its actual value, and see how well the series
approximates the function.
- As a user, I want to figure out how many terms in a Fourier Series I would need to approximate a function in my worklist at a particular value to a specified degree of accuracy.
